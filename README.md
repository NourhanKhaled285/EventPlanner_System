# EventPlanner_System using Oracle database

Faculty events planner system is a system that arranges the faculty events in one accessible place to help students reach the faculty events easily.

Allows admin and faculty teachers to superintend events data and allows them to communicate with students.

The system displays the faculty events in a calendar style so the students can view them prompt, view events details, login to the system and search for different events.

The system allows students to register for faculty events, rate them, and send inquiries to admins.
